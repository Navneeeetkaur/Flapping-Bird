This is a Flappy Bird clone, one of my first python projects. It was made using python-pygame and basic programming concepts..
The objective of this game is to move the bird forward and avoid obstacles along the way. A bird is scrolled to the right side of the screen without getting hit by the pipes placed on its way as obstacles. The bird needs to be flapping constantly otherwise it will fall down and die. A button is used for this flapping.The bird will also die if it hits a pipe or goes up too high and out of sight. Then the game is over. As the bird moves forward, points are added for overcoming the barriers. The pipes are of different heights, making the path more challenging for the player.
